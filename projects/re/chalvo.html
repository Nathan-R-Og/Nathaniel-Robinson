                    <p>After getting into Chameleon Twist, I obviously had
                    to start perusing the developers' other work.</p>
                    <p>One of Japan System Supply's first games was
                    a Gameboy game? This'll be interesting...</p>
                    <p>It's a pretty neat game! Very short and simple,
                        but enough depth to want to keep playing or try
                        around with a couple of new things here and there.</p>
                    <p>So I figured... if I liked it enough, what's stopping
                    me from cracking this puppy open? It's not like people
                    haven't done this with a million other Gameboy games before.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the Chalvo 55 repository was born! It was a little hard
                    to get RGBDS set up, but once it was working it worked like a charm!</p>
                    <p>Currently, almost all <i>data</i> data is completely disassembled and
                    exposed. Main focus right now is on code, though I can't imagine the
                    code of this game is too intricate outside of console routines.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This was also my intro to assembly! I had dabbled with assembly
                    incredibly briefly in 2018 for Super Mario Bros. 3, but that didn't
                    really get anywhere meaningful. Then the Chameleon Twist repo had me
                    turning assembly back into C, so that was also a thing. Though,
                    that was less assembly and more me trying to decipher any readable
                    code from it. Therefore, Chalvo 55 is my <i>ACTUAL</i> intro to 
                    assembly, disassembly and everything with it. Maintaining a project
                    and whatnot. The biz.

                    <p>By the way, this game wasn't supposed to exist! <i>Bound High!</i>
                    for the Virtual Boy got cancelled, so this was made instead! Funny
                    how that works. That game was helmed by the same guy as Chameleon
                    Twist too, so that must've sucked.</p>
