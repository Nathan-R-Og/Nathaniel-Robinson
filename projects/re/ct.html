                    <p>In 2020, I got bored and dug through my Nintendo 64 game collection.
                    I had just recently got a new haul and wanted to see what all
                    was included. You got your Super Mario 64, Snowboard 1080Â°, and then
                    this specific cartridge label stuck out like a sore thumb:</p>
                    <p><i><b>Chameleon Twist</b></i></p>
                    <p>What is this??? An edutainment game for the N64? That's nuts!</p>
                    <p>I turn the game on and am not faced with any kind of educational
                    gameplay. Instead, I'm met with funny scrimblos and jumping. I was
                    in for the perfect ride.</p>
                    <p>After 100%ing the game as all characters, I was satisfied. I
                    wanted to know what everyone else though about this game, so I
                    look it up and find next to nothing. Crazy! Proposterous! There's
                    an entire Discord server dedicated to this game! How is it not
                    more widely known!</p>
                    <p>I start conversing about the game in said server, and learn
                    way more about the game than I probably should! Then I start to
                    get curious... what if I start dissecting this game? Super Mario
                    64 just got completed as a decomp, why can't I do one for this?</p>
                    <p>With a little collaboration and prep, the Chameleon Twist 1 (JP)
                    repository was created on March 22nd, 2022. It was in a <i>very</i>
                    primal state. Especially given I had never done something like this
                    before! It was a massive undertaking.</p>
                    <p>About 3 years later, I can safely say it's been one of the most
                    fun undertakings I've had. Minus maybe code staying at 99% matched,
                    but that's not what I'm in it for. I loved finding out the structure
                    of this game and how it functions, even getting to insert my own
                    stuff in the process! Modding baby!!</p>
                    <p>It's extremely cathartic to just tear into a game (let alone one
                    almost no one bothered doing research on) and dissect it from every
                    angle possible. Getting developer trivia, accessibility to modding
                    and just a comprehensive documentation of the game is my lifeblood.</p>
