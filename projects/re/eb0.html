                    <p>I've always loved the Mother franchise, either for it's usage
                    of the Role-Playing Game medium, or just it's style in general. I had
                    always liked EarthBound, and when the Mother 3 fan translation officially
                    completed, it was a stellar experience! I never hear anything about the
                    first one, though...</p>
                    <p>In 2019, when I played it for the first time on the only official release
                    (the Wii U virutal console), I genuinely had no idea what I was in for.
                    I might as well be playing Dragon Quest at this point! Argh! Why does the
                    grinding suck so bad! Argh! I'm so illiterate!, Needless to say, I didn't
                    quite understand it. I enjoyed what I played, but it felt like more of a
                    slog than a game.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward about 5 years later, I finally have reason to play it all again.
                    This time, though. I allow myself to use a wiki, and there was SO MUCH I MISSED.
                    From every enemy having a check description, to there being shops that just GIVE
                    you armor... I thought I was dreaming! Where was this when I played!!!</p>
                    <p>That wake up call that told me "You played the game wrong!" reclocked my mind.
                    After finishing this new and enlightened run, I <i>got</i> it. The game immediately
                    shot up to my top 10, at LEAST.</p>
                    <p>So, right off the heels of Chalvo 55, what do you think my natural conclusion was?<br>
                    Duh, to start a disassembly!</p>
                    <p>I had a bit of an NES template set up with Donkey Kong Jr. Math, mostly because I thought
                    it'd be funny. However, this game takes SUCH a higher presidence.</p>
                    <p>As of now, the repository has about half of the main game data disassembled, with
                    some left to go. I have barely touched the code since reading that this early without
                    understanding the data types and structure would be a nightmare. I've also mainly focused
                    on understanding where data is called and pointed at, to make mods and linking easier.</p>
                    <p>It's been very fun! The craziest part is half the stuff I found hasn't even been documented yet!
                    You'd think on a game like this it'd be more prevelant, but nope! I get Chameleon Twist and Chalvo,
                    since those are games with double digit populated fanbases, but this???? Come on man.</p>
